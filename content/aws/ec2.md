# üñ•Ô∏è What is EC2? (Layman‚Äôs Understanding)

Think of EC2 as **renting a virtual computer in AWS**.

- You decide the power (CPU/RAM)
- Choose OS (Linux/Windows)
- Install whatever software you need

üí° Example: Need a temporary server to run your backend app or database? Launch an EC2 instance in minutes.
